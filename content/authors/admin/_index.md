I'm currently a PhD student in the Department of Psychological Sciences at Case Western Reserve University, working primarily with Drs. Heath Demaree and Brooke Macnamara. My research focuses on understanding and modeling affective decision-making. Areas of interest include risk and threat perception, the learning and maintenance of mental models, demand-accuracy tradeoffs, and the propensity to choke under threat, pressure, and fear.

I received his B.Sc. in Cognitive Science and Biopsychology from the University of Michigan, and served as a post-baccalaureate researcher in the labs of Drs. William Killgore and Vinod Menon, at the University of Arizona and Stanford University, respectively. I've previously studied the effects of psychological stress (i.e., peer pressure, monetary incentives), and physiological stress (i.e., sleep deprivation, mild electric shock) on complex cognitive performance, as well as the effects of domain-specific training and anxiety on neurodevelopmental trajectories in math learning.
